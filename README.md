# [Super Off Road](https://Orphen5.github.io/SuperOffRoad/)

This is a really simplified version of the original [online emulator](http://www.letsplaysega.com/play-super-off-road-online/) of Super Off Road. It is build using SDL and C++.

The graphics are extracted from [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/superoffroad/) and manually ripped.

## How To Play 🎮
To play the game, download the .zip from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Orphen5/SuperOffRoad/releases) and extract it to any folder. Once extracted, execute __SuperOffRoad.exe__.

- _Right_ _arrow_ to turn right and _left_ _arrow_ to turn left.
